## I will be writing all the steps here
# first step  is making a store
## import configure store from redux toolkit
## export it directly 
## making a slicing
### it si actuallay a feature or function
### so what exactly is slice its like making a feature
### first import it form redux tool kit 
### create slice as welll as nanoid= unique id of each no need to use random gebbrish
### set the intial state what it contain 
### make a export function
### first it contain name then initial state and then reducer
### what is reducer
### its like the function not only definition but declaration
### inn reducer we have access of two thing state current state and the action 
### action .payload. anything it actuallay contain the value
### in slice first we have to export the whole function other than that we to export reducer separately becouse this is the functionality which is being used at the end
## so passing the reducer to the store is like registring it ky yeh hon gye yeh kaam kryen gye
